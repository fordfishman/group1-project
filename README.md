Title:
A Time Series Analysis of Species Abundance in Latin America and The Caribbean Before and After the Ratification of the international Convention on Biological Diversity

Background:

Over time, the relative abundance of many animal species has been decreasing due to a variety of factors, such as overhunting, habitat loss, and climate change.
In response to these trends, countries around the world have passed both internal legislation to protect at-risk populations,
as well as formed international agreements with other countries in order to address the problem of biodiversity loss.
While not necessarily legally binding, international agreements represent a significant effort by member countries to work together towards the common goal of
preserving biodiversity. This is especially important when there is no physical boundary separating countries, as species can travel freely between them and
subsequently be subject to different laws regarding their protection. One of these international agreements which will be the focus of this project is the
Convention on Biological Diversity (1992), which covers all ecosystems, species, and genetic resources found in the world. 

Research Question:

Looking specifically at Latin America and the Caribbean due to the high amount of biodiversity in the region, how has the rate of biodiversity and species richness changed the past 50 years? Did the implementation of a major international agreement in 1992 have any significant correlation or impact on the rate of species decline? We will determine this by using a time series analysis on species diversity in the region before and after the implementation of the Convention on Biodiversity.


Hypothesis and next step:
Our hypothesis for now is that the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity reduces the rate of species decrease before the implementation of this international agreement in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our next step would be to start cleaning our species abundance data and go from there.
